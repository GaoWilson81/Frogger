# This project's goal
--- 
In this game, the player controls a character attempting to cross both rivers and roads. Roads are composed of separate lanes,
each filled with vehicles of varying colors, speeds, and lengths moving in a direction specific to the lane.
Rivers are also divided into separate lanes, in each of which logs float across the screen (which vary in
speed, length, and direction). Rivers can be crossed by hopping on these logs in succession before they
move off the screen. There may also be obstacles of different widths and heights scattered throughout
the map, which the player is not hurt by but cannot cross. The goal of the game is to reach a goal tile at
the other end of the game map.
